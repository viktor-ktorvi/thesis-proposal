\section*{Methodology}

This is the methodology.

\begin{itemize}
    \item To correct for the lackings of the existing literature I will work on a fixed split public dataset, add interpretable metrics etc.
    \item I still wanna use GNNs for their ability to adapt to multi-topology data but to improve their performance I plan to use something that extends their reach like graph transformers, maybe jhop, probably not k-WL and the likes unless it can incorporate node and edge attributes
\end{itemize}
