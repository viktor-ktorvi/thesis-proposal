\section*{Introduction}

This is an introduction.

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the OPF problem
    \item Why is it important
    \item What are the challenges(single/multi topology)
    \item Evidence that 1-WL bound GNNs underperform
\end{itemize}

TODO Run sweeps for MLP Global, MLP Local, and fill out a table. Maybe add the oversmoothing graph in the appendix.
